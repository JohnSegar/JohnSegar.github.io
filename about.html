## About

For the past 3 years I was training for the MET Police Force, in order to gain the adequate experience to apply for the UN Peacekeeping force. Due to a change in Government policies and priorities, my application was put on hold indefinitely. Therefore I needed to do some soul searching and find what step I wanted to take next. After looking into it and speaking to friends that were already in the industry, Web Development was the next step forward. My only regret is not having taken that step sooner.
